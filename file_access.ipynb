      "\n",
      "When designing AI applications, you face a fundamental trade-off between **control** and **freedom**:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Freedom** gives your LLM more room to be creative and tackle unexpected problems.\n",
      "- **Control** allows you to ensure predictable behavior and maintain guardrails.\n",
      "\n",
      "Code Agents, like the ones you can encounter in _smolagents_, are very free. They can call multiple tools in a single action step, create their own tools, etc. However, this behavior can make them less predictable and less controllable than a regular Agent working with JSON!\n",
      "\n",
      "`LangGraph` is on the other end of the spectrum, it shines when you need **“Control”** on the execution of your agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is particularly valuable when you need **Control over your applications**. It gives you the tools to build an application that follows a predictable process while still leveraging the power of LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put simply, if your application involves a series of steps that need to be orchestrated in a specific way, with decisions being made at each junction point, **LangGraph provides the structure you need**.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key scenarios where LangGraph excels include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Multi-step reasoning processes** that need explicit control on the flow\n",
      "- **Applications requiring persistence of state** between steps\n",
      "- **Systems that combine deterministic logic with AI capabilities**\n",
      "- **Workflows that need human-in-the-loop interventions**\n",
      "- **Complex agent architectures** with multiple components working together\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, whenever possible, **as a human**, design a flow of actions based on the output of each action, and decide what to execute next accordingly. In this case, LangGraph is the correct framework for you!\n",

The tool can be called with all the parameters needed to trigger `load_data` from the data loader, along with a natural language query string. During execution, we first load data from the data loader, index it (for instance with a vector store), and then query it ‘on-demand’. All three of these steps happen in a single tool call.\n",
      "2. `LoadAndSearchToolSpec`: The LoadAndSearchToolSpec takes in any existing Tool as input. As a tool spec, it implements `to_tool_list`, and when that function is called, two tools are returned: a loading tool and then a search tool. The load Tool execution would call the underlying Tool, and then index the output (by default with a vector index). The search Tool execution would take in a query string as input and call the underlying index.\n",

      "7.  Agentic RAG (Singh et al., 2025)\n",
