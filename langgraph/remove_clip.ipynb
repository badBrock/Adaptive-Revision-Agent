      "──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "**Question:** \n",
      "\n",
      "How do the MCP Server Primitives (Tools, Resources, and Prompts) interact and contribute to the overall workflow depicted in the first image, particularly in terms of control, usage, and information flow between the User, Our Server, MCP Client, MCP Server, Claude, and Github? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale:** \n",
      "\n",
      "This question requires the test-taker to demonstrate an understanding of both images and how they relate to each other. The first image shows a complex workflow involving multiple entities, while the second image provides a categorization of MCP Server Primitives into Tools, Resources, and Prompts, each with distinct characteristics and use cases. \n",
      "\n",
      "To answer this question correctly, the test-taker must be able to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the different components of the MCP Server Primitives and their roles.\n",
      "2. Understand how these primitives are used in the workflow depicted in the first image.\n",
      "3. Analyze how the control, usage, and information flow between the entities in the workflow are influenced\n",

      "──────────────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "## Feedback on User's Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's answer, \"using an http server which lets use easily connect to the tool or the server or the database right?\" touches on the idea of using a server for communication but does not fully address the question. The question asks for a detailed explanation of how MCP Server Primitives (Tools, Resources, and Prompts) interact and contribute to the workflow, including control, usage, and information flow between entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Points for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify MCP Server Primitives:** The user did not explicitly mention Tools, Resources, and Prompts or their characteristics.\n",
      "2. **Understand Usage in Workflow:** The answer lacks detail on how these primitives are used in the depicted workflow.\n",
      "3. **Analyze Control, Usage, and Information Flow:** The user did not analyze how these aspects are influenced by the primitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Review the definitions and roles of Tools, Resources, and Prompts.\n",
      "- Study the workflow diagram to see how these primitives are utilized.\n",
      "- Consider how control, usage, and information flow are managed among the entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's answer shows a basic understanding but lacks depth. Further review of the provided images and details will help in providing a more accurate and complete response. Keep working on understanding the workflow and primitives.\n",
