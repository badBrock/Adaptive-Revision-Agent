INFO:tools.question_planner:📋 Successfully planned 3 questions
INFO:quiz_agent:📋 QuestionPlanner generated 3 questions

🎯 Question 1/3 (medium)
📝 What is the problem with zero initialization?
💡 Provide your answer

👤 Your answer: in zero initilzation the neural network just die out as it has no weights to udpate or to infer with.  
INFO:quiz_agent:📝 User answered: 'in zero initilzation the neural network just die out as it has no weights to udpate or to infer with.'
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

💭 Feedback: The user's answer could be improved by providing a more precise explanation, specifically that zero initialization leads to the dying ReLU problem where neurons output zero for all inputs, resulting in no updates during backpropagation.
INFO:tools.scorer:🎯 Scoring answer: 'in zero initilzation the neural network just die out as it has no weights to udpate or to infer with.' for question: 'What is the problem with zero initialization?...'
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:tools.scorer:🎯 Score assigned: 60.0/100

🎯 Score: 60.0/100

🎯 Question 2/3 (medium)
📝 What type of initialization is recommended?
💡 Provide your answer

👤 Your answer: i would recommend using he or xavier initilization technique which can tackle the vanishing gradient problem as well as exploding gradient problem esp with an activation function like relu.
INFO:quiz_agent:📝 User answered: 'i would recommend using he or xavier initilization technique which can tackle the vanishing gradient problem as well as exploding gradient problem esp with an activation function like relu.'
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

💭 Feedback: The answer effectively recommends He or Xavier initialization as a solution to tackle the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, especially when used with activation functions like ReLU.
INFO:tools.scorer:🎯 Scoring answer: 'i would recommend using he or xavier initilization technique which can tackle the vanishing gradient problem as well as exploding gradient problem esp with an activation function like relu.' for question: 'What type of initialization is recommended?...'
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:tools.scorer:🎯 Score assigned: 70.0/100

🎯 Score: 70.0/100

🎯 Question 3/3 (medium)
📝 What problem occurs with large weights?
💡 Provide your answer

👤 Your answer: large weight would mean that the neural network has unstable convergence as on updation of the weight in gradient descent. the training would be ineffic

INFO:quiz_agent:📝 User answered: 'large weight would mean that the neural network has unstable convergence as on updation of the weight in gradient descent. the training would be inefficient'
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

💭 Feedback: The user's answer is close but could be more precise, as large weights primarily lead to the vanishing or exploding gradient problem rather than just unstable convergence and inefficient training.
